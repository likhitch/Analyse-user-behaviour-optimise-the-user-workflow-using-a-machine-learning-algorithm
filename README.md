# Analyse-user-behaviour-optimise-the-user-workflow-using-a-machine-learning-algorithm

User Behavior Analytics or UBA focuses on what the user is doing: apps
launched, network activity, and, most critically files accessed (when the
file or email was touched, who touched it, what was done with it and how
frequently).
UBA technology searches for patterns of usage that indicate unusual or
anomalous behavior — regardless of whether the activities are coming
from a hacker, insider, or even malware or other processes. While UBA
won’t prevent hackers or insiders from getting into your system, it can
quickly spot their work and minimize damage.
I have integrated my website to analytics platform named Google
Analytics. This tool is able to track the users action and the time spent by
the users on the various actions of the website. I have accumulated the
analytics data from various users and stored it.
